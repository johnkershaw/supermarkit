Google Classroom Student Reports

Pulls courses, students, grades and guardians from Classroom, creates an end of semester report using your template, generates PDFS and emails them to guardians.

STATUS: First semester reports went out on time, but required lots of teacher hands-on. Version 2 should automate more of that.
