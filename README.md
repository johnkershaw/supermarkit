Google Classroom Student Reports

Pulls courses, students, grades and guardians from Classroom, creates an end of semester report using your template, generates PDFS and emails them to guardians.

STATUS: Into our 5th semester using SuperMarkIt, all running pretty smoothly (tardy teachers are the biggest problem!).

INSTALL: Copy the main script to your Apps Script account, duplicate the Reportbooks Dec2020 spreadsheet, connect the two. Run tasks from the 'Admin' menu.
